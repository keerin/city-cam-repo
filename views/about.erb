	  		<h1>About the City Cam Repo</h1>
	  		<p>If you are a voyeur but not the perverted kind and like to watch publicly accessible webcams from around the world then this is the site for you!</p>
	  		<p>This website came about thanks to Twitter user <a href="https://www.twitter.com/thecish" target="_blank">@thecish</a> sending a tweet into the ether about his desire for a website that showed you webcams of streets and traffic from around the world. While there may be others, hopefully <a href="https://www.twitter.com/thecish" target="_blank">@thecish</a> and others will enjoy this easy to use repository of publically acessible webcams.</p>
